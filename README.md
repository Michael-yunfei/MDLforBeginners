This repository is built for teaching beginners machine learning and deep learning. The topics covered in this course are quite standard, which should include the follows provisionally:

* Linear Methods for Regression
* Linear Methods for Classification
* Model Assessment and Selection
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Standard Neutral Networks
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Recurrent Neutral Network (RNN)

Since this is an ongoing project, I might change the teaching content based on the feedback provided by future students. After finishing this course, students are expected to:

* have a big picture on machine learning;
* understand key models in machine learning;
* know how to build a machine learning model based on problems they wish to tackle.


该仓库是为教授初学者人工智能而建。目前拟定的题目包括:

* 线性回归模型
* 线性分类模型
* 模型评估与筛选
* 向量机分类(SVM)
* 简易神经网络模型
* 卷积神经网络模型(CNN)
* 递归神经网络模型(RNN)

完成此课程后，学生应该完成以下目标:

* 掌握人工智能的基本框架
* 理解所介绍过的模型原理
* 可以建立一个人工智能模型来解决具体的问题
